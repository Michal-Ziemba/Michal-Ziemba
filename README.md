### Hi
My name is Michal [me+how].
I use my passion for Microsoft 365 and Power Platform to make business processes more optimized, efficient and secure.
Together with other community members we create Baltic Power Platform Community. Except our monthly meetings I organize 
Global Power Platform Bootcamp Polish Edition and [Baltic Summit](https://balticsummit.pl).
As a trainer (MCT), I share my over two decades of experience in Microsoft services with others during classes and conferences.
